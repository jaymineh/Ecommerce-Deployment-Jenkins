# Automating Deployment Of An E-Commerce Website

This is an end-to-end deployment of an e-commerce website. This deployment details everything up from when the developer pushes their code to containerized deployment. This deployment entails setting up the infrastructure, setting up the CI and webserver, configuring webhooks, creating a pipeline file for deployment, include the different stages of building and running the app, perform unit testing and finally uploading the containerized image to a repository.
